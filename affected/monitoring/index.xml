        <title>Ion and Tin Experiencing Minor Issues</title>

        <description>Update October 19, 8:40am: A fix has been identified for unclickable links on the Ion Dashboard will be deployed as soon as possible. To circumvent this for now, zoom out the page (Ctrl -) and the buttons will work. Tin is adjusting to the higher load from computer science classes, and may respond slower than normal, but has been restored to normal functionality. \n Initial update, October 18, 7:52pm: Starting at 11pm on October 17, Ion started responding with 500 Internal Server Errors after a routine deployment.</description>

This was resolved midmorning October 18. However, some minor lingering issues persist including widget links on the right of the Dashboard intermittently not working. This can be circumvented using the left navigation bar. Some users are also reporting timeouts and/or session expirations on Tin; we encourage users to use a code editing application and upload a file instead of using the built-in web editor at this time. We apologize for the inconvenience; Sysadmins are working on complete restoration of services. We are also continuing to investigate the cause of the issues and will provide an update when we have more information.&lt;/p&gt;
